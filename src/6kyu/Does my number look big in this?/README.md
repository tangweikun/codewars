# Does my number look big in this?

## Description

A Narcissistic Number is a number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example, take 153 (3 digits):

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

and 1634 (4 digits):

    1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634
