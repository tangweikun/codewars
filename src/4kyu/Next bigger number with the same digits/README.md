# Next bigger number with the same digits

## Description

You have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:

```js
nextBigger(12) == 21
nextBigger(513) == 531
nextBigger(2017) == 2071
```

If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:

```js
nextBigger(9) == -1
nextBigger(111) == -1
nextBigger(531) == -1
```
